# TODO

## Now

## Next

## Soon

- Sort out children vs. content and the vhtml typing issue

## Eventually

- A real `resourceType`
- Re-invent collections
  - Change fixtures and typing to treat `collections.all` with the correct structure
  - Have `collections.resources` which is an object with properties for `all`, etc.
  - Use Map to allow iteration and preserve default sort order
  - Investigate `--incremental` by storing the validated resource on the `collections.all` instance
    - Learn watch events and add/edit/delete
    - Both for full and incremental
