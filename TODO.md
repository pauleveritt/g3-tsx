# TODO

## Now

- Spell background repeat correctly on hero

## Next

## Soon

- Lunr
  - NavbarSearch reveal panel
- TwitterCard stuff and other Helmet
- JSON Schema writing

## Eventually

- Suppress all the vite logging that fills up startup messages
- A real `resourceType` for collections, page
- Sort out children vs. content and the vhtml typing issue
- Investigate `--incremental` by storing the validated resource on the `collections.all` instance
  - Learn watch events and add/edit/delete
  - Both for full and incremental

## Nice To Have

- JSON Schemas
- HTMX
- "MDX" by enabling WebC as markdown template language
- Coverage

## Finished

- Individual pages for each reference type
- Get rid of readMarkdownTree and duplicative tests
- Reorg content models to getAuthors etc. to the actual resource
- Baked-in approach to E2E testing that runs during build
  - View renders have `this.addTestCase` to register some assertions for a resulting page at a URL
  - After build, all the test cases are run, with an exception for violations
- Move layouts out of the root, into `layouts/`
- Move generic models out of `_includes` into `src`
- Start some docs
- Land a proper `resourceType`
- Create re-invented collections
  - More automated via a call from eleventy config
  - Pre-sorted `Set`
- De-prop the layouts
- Change referenceResources to linkedResources
- Change TipResource to Tip
  - Then get rid of that key in config
- Remove `content` from `BaseData`
- Wire in TipSidebar into TipLayout
- Re-invent collections
  - Change fixtures and typing to treat `collections.all` with the correct structure
  - Have `collections.resources` which is an object with properties for `all`, etc.
  - Use Map to allow iteration and preserve default sort order
- Tutorials
- Make schemas for just the frontmatter part
- Change label to be topic:label key
- Copy PyCharm Guide over
  - Rename dir structure to `sites/webstorm/guide`
  - Some post-build task to copy `assets` into `_site/webstorm/guide`
- Figure out the `site.json` config file
- Style misfire in code snippets on `number`
- Get home pages to match current home pages
- Ensure `embed:` alternative with `{% include %}`
- Implement NavbarBrand toggle menu

## WS+CWM Issues

- Markdown preview 404
  - When Khalid made me follow him on my machine, and we opened `.md`, preview showed 404
- Breadcrumbs are visible but not activated on click
- Asks to forward the debugger port
- Doesn't highlight links in run window
- Can't view images in editor

## Things To Show Zach

- Vite
- TS
- TSX
- Vitest
- TypeBox "content types"
- Switch to collections.author rather than collections.authorReferences in get**
- Playlists revamp


# Manual Migration Tasks

- Rename dir structure to `sites/webstorm/guide`
- Move `contents` children to root
- Copy `index.md` and `*.11tydata.json` files into appropriate directories
- Change tutorialItems to remove prefix
- Change playlistItems to add prefix
- Remove `vimscript` as a code fence language
- Convert any `embed:` in Markdown files to include from local `demos` directory
- Put the following in tutorial frontmatter:
  ```
  resourceType: tutorial
  layout: "resources/tutorial/TutorialLayout.11ty.tsx"
  ```
- Add `templateEngineOverride: "md"` in TutorialStep as needed
- Delete pycharm-guide/contents/tutorials/sphinx_sites/blog as it is unused
-
